        <p>
          The innovative "Digitizing Women-Centric Events in Ward 17" project
          aims to use digital technology to document and promote activities and
          events organized by and for women in Kathmandu Ward 17. By developing
          a central, user-friendly web portal, this project will make sure that
          more people can access details about activities that encourage women
          empowerment and participation, which will improve community support
          and involvement.
        </p>

          This program aims to fill the gap in easily available and consistent
          data regarding events that primarily focus on women in Ward 17. The
          project aims to promote inclusivity and empowerment by creating a
          comprehensive digital archive that showcases the accomplishments and
          continuing initiatives in women's empowerment within the community.
